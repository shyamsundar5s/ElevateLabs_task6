# Mall Customer Segmentation with K-Means & KNN
Welcome to Task 6 of the ElevateLabs series! In this project, we dive into customer segmentation using unsupervised learning (K-Means) and explore the foundations for classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## 🎯 Objective
**Task 6:** Understand and implement K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification problems, with a focus on practical customer segmentation using K-Means clustering.
- **Tools:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File:** `Mall_Customers.csv`
- **Features:**
  - `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
  - `Gender`: Male/Female
  - `Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Customer’s annual income (in thousands)
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score based on customer behavior and spending
